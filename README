fengshui README
===============

fengshui is a rack diagram generator.

The input format is XML, which you can see in the file example.feng.

The output format is currently PNG, using the cairo vector graphics library
(fengshui used to generate PostScript and SVG directly, but cairo already did
all this and more and I like having less code to worry about -- however you
need PostScript support built into cairo for it to work...)

Run like so:

    python fengshui.py -o example.png example.feng

If you don't give it an output file, it'll write to standard out.
