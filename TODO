- make a gtk app

- make this gtk app capable of editing rack diagrams, so one isn't eaten alive by XML

- wrap in a scroll guy.  zoom, panning.

- refactor unit size calculations, out of rack.py, put all into rack2cairo

- move shelf child code into RackElement, allowing all RackElements to carry children

- remove 'affinity' tag, assume top to bottom fill

- ? add align tag for box elements to put on right hand side of rack?
